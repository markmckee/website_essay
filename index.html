        <p>
            For my Essay I will be discussing in my own opinion how Tim Berners lee changed the way that we now communicate. The quote that has always stuck with me from Tim Berners Lee is:
        </p>
    
            <blockquote>“I believe we can build a Web that is truly for everyone: one that is accessible to all, from any device, and one that empowers all of us to achieve our dignity, rights, and potential as humans.”<cite>- Tim Berners-Lee.</cite>
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            
        The main facts that I will take into consideration to form my opinion will be:
            
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The World wide web and how it has changed the 20th and 21st Century in the forms of communication and also the advantages and disadvantages of the World Wide Web
        </p>
            

                <a name="the-world-wide-web"></a>
<section id class="the-world-wide-web-content">

        <h2>The World Wide Web</h2>
            <img src="images/world-wide-web-image.jpeg" alt="world-wide-web img" class="center">
    
        <p>
            Before the creation of the World Wide Web the main source of communication was the telephone. There were other forms of communication still being used. For example, Morse code and the printing press. The printing press tool helped shape our world from the 15th century and is still widely used today to communicate. The printing press is used to share information via posters, books, advertisements, propaganda etc.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            If you think about it, the world wide web is a digital version of this but on a much larger scale reaching areas of the world that many would not think possible when the world wide web was first designed. When Tim Berners Lee first proposed the idea of the World Wide Web to his boss, he labelled it himself as <blockquote“>vague but exciting”</blockquote“> 
            
        </p>
    The elements required for this exciting new design known was the World Wide Web were:
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>URI</li>
        <li>HTTP</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    HTML which stands for Hypertext Mark-up Language was a vital part of the process for his design as it is essentially the building block of a webpage.  It is used to design the structure of the webpage. This was very important for the design as it makes a webpage user friendly and understandable for a user. Over the years of development, the amount of designing that you can do to a website is almost limitless as new structure designs are developed. This is seen as the backbone where all designs begin.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 2nd element that was needed for the World Wide Web was URI which stands for Uniform Resource Identifier.  It is now known as URL and provides the website with an address to make it easier for the user to find a specific website.
    </p>

    <p>HTTP which stands for hypertext transfer protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted on the world wide web.
    </p>

    <p>
        The impact that the World Wide Web has had on not only our communication but as a society, I feel that nobody could have predicted the scale of how big it has become. By developing this design, it has had an impact on everything around us and how we now think and communicate in the 21st century. By being able to send information to anyone and to also share your information with another peer within minutes in today shows how much of an effect an idea in your head can impact the world as we know it.

    <h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
    
        <p>
            The most popular form of communication in the 21st century using the world wide web is social media. For this part of my essay I take each of these points and discuss the advantages and disadvantages relating to the aspects and effects of social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main social media websites that are being used today are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facebook</li>
                            <li>Twitter</li>
                            <li>Instagram</li>
                            <li>Snapchat</li>
                        </ul>
    
        <img src="images/social-media-rise.svg" alt="social-media-rise" class="center">
            <blockquote>“there are 7.7 billion people in the world, with at least 3.5 billion of us online”</blockquote>
        <p>
            This means that over a third of the world’s population has connected to social media to communicate. From this statistic you can see that the growth of social media communication is extraordinary and has become one of the main forms of communication in today’s society.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This is huge advantage for many different reasons. It helps with advertising for any kind of business by getting communication spread across the world instantly. One of social medias main use to connect with others from the comfort of your own home, long distance etc. Apps like snapchat and Instagram have also changed forms of communication. Their main way for users to communicate through images
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Instant messaging is another huge factor that the internet has had a positive impact on society. The ability to send instant messages to anyone around the world has not only impacted the ease of communication for family and friends. It has also impacted the communication used for businesses and emergency   services.
        </p> 

        <p>
            Video Calling is another reason on how we communication has changed. With the technology we have today, we can now video call to anyone else in the world which in my opinion shows how fast technology is changing society and the way we think and see what is possible in the 21st century. Video calling is now essential for business meetings and can is now common to be used for online interviews.

    <h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
        <img src="images/mental-health-image.jpeg" alt="mental-health-rise" class="center">
            <p>
                While there are many advantages that have came with the World Wide Web there are also disadvantages that I will take into consideration. While social media is seen as a huge advantage with communication there are many negative effects that have come with this style of communication on society.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                One of the main disadvantages of the internet is the rise of mental health issues mainly surrounding teens that use social media.<blockquote>“We found a substantial increase in major depression or suicidal thoughts, psychological distress, and more attempted suicides after 2010, versus the mid-2000s, and that increase was by far the largest in adolescents and young adults,”. “These trends are weak or non-existent among adults 26 years and over, suggesting a generational shift in mood disorders instead of an overall increase across all ages.”<cite>lead author Jean Twenge, author of the book “iGen”</cite> 
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                From this study I believe that with the increased use of social media it has had an effect on teens and young adults due to the rise beginning in the mid 2000s when social media apps began. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The Instagram generation has had a major negative factor on the mental health of young teens. Due to the fact that you can now add filters to photos it shows unrealistic proportions and features which can be shown as a bad light in my opinion for young people looking up to these people. 
            </p>

<section id class="internet-addiction-content">
    <h2 id="internet-addiction">Internet Addiction</h2>
        <img src="images/internet-addiction-image.jpg" alt="internet-addiction" class="center">
        
        <p>
            Another one of the disadvantages from internet is internet addiction.  Many people may not think that they have this addiction but when you put it into perspective it can be seen as a lot more common. It can range from a lot of things such as shopping online, playing video games online or checking social media daily.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            While these things are now seen as the norm of today’s world it can start to become a problem when you check your social media accounts more frequently in your daily life. This can lead to the signs of internet addiction where the loneliness comes in to play.
        </p>  
        
        <p>
            One of the main problems that leads to internet addiction disorder is that the technology that is now available to everyone allows them to do everything possible online. For example, we can now shop for clothes without needing to go down to a store, we can order food online instead of driving to the place to order, we can communicate with friends online without needing to see them in person.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This lifestyle can then lead to internet addiction disorder.  An article wrote by KW Beard in 2005 proposed five symptoms to help identify internet addiction disorder. These symptoms in the article are listed below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is preoccupied with the Internet (constantly thinks about past use or future use)</li>
                        <li>Needs to use the Internet with increased amounts of time to gain satisfaction</li>
                        <li>Has made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop use of the Internet</li>
                        <li>Is restless, moody, depressed, or irritable when attempting to control Internet use</li>
                        <li>Has stayed online longer than originally intended</li>
                    </ul>

    <section id class="conclusion-content">
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
   
            <p>
                By looking through my points while they a many positives for communication such as world-wide communication now available in an instant there will of course be some negative effects that come with this huge success. 
            </p>   
        
            <p>
                From the studies and quotes that I have referenced you can see that mental health issues have risen due to the toxic nature of social media apps and the Instagram generation.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                While many apps are considering revamping the idea of social media to help with online bullying and the cause of mental health issues. Internet addiction is also one of the main concerns as it can cause harm to the body including lack of sleep and loneliness. Overall, I feel that while the internet is now a daily part of life we should be using social media apps in moderation.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                To conclude my essay my question was “how has Tim Berners-Lee changed how we communicate” In my own opinion I believe that he has massively, and it has been an overall more positive improvement on communication and society instead of a negative effect.
